				<h1>History of the National Registry of Ducks Named Kevin</h1>

				<h2>The Pre-Registry Era (Before 2003)</h2>
				<p>Prior to the establishment of the NRDNK, duck naming in the United States was an entirely unregulated activity. Citizens were free to name ducks anything they wished, and frequently did. The name &ldquo;Kevin&rdquo; was particularly popular in the mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest regions, leading to what officials would later describe as &ldquo;a Kevin situation.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>By the late 1990s, an estimated 1,200 ducks in the greater Chesapeake Bay area alone answered to the name Kevin, creating significant confusion during annual waterfowl censuses. Census workers reported that calling &ldquo;Kevin&rdquo; at any public pond would attract between four and seventeen ducks, none of whom could be reliably distinguished from one another without federal-grade identification bands.</p>

				<h2>The Great Unnamed Duck Incident of 2002</h2>
				<p>On September 3, 2002, a routine audit of the Potomac River Waterfowl Corridor revealed that approximately 400 to 600 ducks believed to be named Kevin were, in fact, entirely undocumented. They had no registration numbers, no bread consumption records, and no assigned flyway division. Several appeared to be using aliases.</p>

				<p>The discovery prompted an emergency session of the Subcommittee on Waterfowl Nomenclature Standards, which met continuously for eleven days in a windowless conference room at the Department of the Interior. The resulting report, &ldquo;Where Are All These Kevins Coming From: An Urgent Assessment,&rdquo; ran to 847 pages and recommended the immediate creation of a centralized Kevin registry.</p>

				<h2>Executive Order 13,242 (March 14, 2003)</h2>
				<p>President Bush signed Executive Order 13,242, formally establishing the National Registry of Ducks Named Kevin as a division of the newly created U.S. Department of Waterfowl Nomenclature. The order mandated that all ducks currently named Kevin be registered within 180 days, and that all future Kevin namings be pre-approved through Form NRDNK-1.</p>

				<p>The initial registration drive was described by participants as &ldquo;logistically harrowing.&rdquo; Field agents were dispatched to 14,000 ponds, lakes, and decorative water features across the country. Many ducks proved uncooperative.</p>

				<h2>The Digital Transition (2012&ndash;2016)</h2>
				<p>In 2012, Congress allocated $4.2 million to digitize the Registry&rsquo;s paper records, which at that point occupied three storage units in Bethesda, Maryland. The project was completed in 2016, four years behind schedule but under budget, primarily because several boxes turned out to contain only bread crumbs and a single photograph labeled &ldquo;Kevin?&rdquo;</p>

				<h2>The Modern Registry (2016&ndash;Present)</h2>
				<p>Today, the NRDNK maintains records for over 2,800 registered Kevins across all 50 states, two territories, and one disputed pond on the Canadian border. The Registry processes an average of 340 new Kevin registrations per year and maintains a 97.3% Kevin identification accuracy rate, which the department considers &ldquo;extremely good, all things considered.&rdquo;</p>
