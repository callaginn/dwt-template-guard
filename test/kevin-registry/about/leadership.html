				<h1>NRDNK Leadership &amp; Organization</h1>

				<h2>Office of the Registrar General</h2>
				<p>The Registrar General is the senior-most official of the National Registry of Ducks Named Kevin and reports directly to the Secretary of Waterfowl Nomenclature. The Registrar General is responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and general dignity of the Registry at all times.</p>

				<h3>Dr. Patricia Mallardson, Registrar General</h3>
				<p>Dr. Mallardson has served as Registrar General since 2018, following a distinguished 22-year career in federal waterfowl administration. She holds a Ph.D. in Avian Identity Studies from Georgetown University and a Master&rsquo;s in Bureaucratic Ornithology from the University of Maryland. Under her leadership, the Registry achieved its highest-ever Kevin identification accuracy rate of 97.3% and successfully resolved the 2021 &ldquo;Two Kevins, One Pond&rdquo; jurisdictional crisis without incident.</p>

				<h2>Division of Kevin Registration &amp; Processing</h2>
				<p>This division handles all incoming Form NRDNK-1 submissions, photograph verification, and bread preference assessments. The division maintains a staff of 14 Registration Specialists and operates a 24-hour Kevin Verification Hotline during peak migration season (March&ndash;May and September&ndash;November).</p>

				<h3>Gerald T. Breadworth, Deputy Registrar for Processing</h3>
				<p>Deputy Registrar Breadworth oversees all intake operations and is credited with reducing the average Kevin registration processing time from 16 weeks to 10 weeks through the introduction of a second stapler. He previously served as Regional Kevin Coordinator for the Atlantic Flyway Division, where he personally registered over 400 Kevins.</p>

				<h2>Division of Field Operations &amp; Kevin Recovery</h2>
				<p>Field Operations is responsible for the physical verification of registered Kevins, the investigation of unregistered Kevin activity, and the recovery of missing Kevins. The division operates twelve field offices across eight flyway regions and maintains a fleet of specially equipped observation vehicles.</p>

				<h3>Agent Sandra Pondsworth, Chief of Field Operations</h3>
				<p>Chief Pondsworth leads a team of 28 field agents responsible for on-the-ground Kevin verification and recovery operations. A 15-year veteran of the department, she was instrumental in Operation Bread Trail (2019), which successfully located and re-registered 23 Kevins who had migrated outside their authorized flyway corridors without filing Form NRDNK-M3 (Request for Temporary Migration Variance).</p>

				<h2>Office of Bread Activity Monitoring</h2>
				<p>This office maintains the national Bread Consumption Log and monitors bread-related activity at all federally recognized Kevin habitats. It is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Responsible Bread Distribution Guidelines (RBDG) and investigating reports of unauthorized bread events.</p>

				<h3>Marcus Crumbley, Director of Bread Operations</h3>
				<p>Director Crumbley has overseen bread monitoring since 2015 and is the author of the department&rsquo;s definitive handbook, &ldquo;Bread and the Modern Kevin: A Federal Perspective.&rdquo; Under his direction, the office has catalogued over 1.2 million individual bread consumption events and identified three previously unknown bread preferences among registered Kevins (pumpernickel, focaccia, and &ldquo;whatever that is&rdquo;).</p>

				<h2>Regional Flyway Divisions</h2>
				<p>The NRDNK operates through eight regional flyway divisions, each headed by a Regional Kevin Coordinator. These divisions are responsible for local Kevin registration, pond inspections, and community outreach. For a complete list of regional offices and their contact information, please call 1-800-555-KEVIN or visit your nearest federal waterfowl service center.</p>
