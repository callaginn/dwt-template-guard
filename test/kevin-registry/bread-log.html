					<h1>Federal Bread Activity Log</h1>
					
					<div class="notice">
						<h4>Public Notice &mdash; February 2026</h4>
						<p>Feeding bread to a registered Kevin without logging the event is a violation. Sourdough and pumpernickel must be logged separately. Brioche remains under review (and yes, we can tell; the crumbs have a distinct smugness). Please allow 5&ndash;7 business days for the Portal to recognize you have always been the Portal&rsquo;s user.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>The following is the official log of all documented bread consumption events by federally registered Kevins in the Eastern Flyway Division. All entries are filed by certified NRDNK Field Agents or through the Civilian Bread Reporting Portal (CBRP). Entries are reviewed for accuracy within 30&ndash;60 business days of submission, depending on staffing, weather, and whether the Portal remembers your password.</p>
					<p>The Registry is required by the Waterfowl Nutritional Transparency Act of 2011 to maintain a public record of all bread events. We take no position on bread, only on recordkeeping and the quiet thrill of compliance.</p>

					<div class="notice">
						<h4>Data Disclaimer</h4>
						<p>These records represent only <em>reported</em> bread events. The NRDNK acknowledges that significant quantities of unreported bread may have been consumed. We are doing our best. The ducks are not cooperating with audits, and the audits are not cooperating with our scheduling software.</p>

						<p class="entry-body"><strong>KV-0042 (Kevin, Mallard)</strong> &mdash; Consumed approximately 40g of sourdough bread, torn into irregular pieces and scattered on the water surface by a tourist in a Columbia jacket.

						<p class="entry-body"><strong>KV-0089 (Kevin, Pekin Duck)</strong> &mdash; Accepted approximately 25g of plain white bread from a child, age approximately 7, under the supervision of a parent who was clearly not aware of the NRDNK bread reporting requirements. Parent was issued a verbal warning and provided with a copy of Pamphlet NRDNK-B2 (<em>Bread and the Law: What Every Duck-Feeder Should Know</em>).

						<p class="entry-body"><strong>KV-0601 (Kevin, formerly Gary, Mallard)</strong> &mdash; Consumed a full sourdough roll, approximately 80g, discovered unattended on a park bench. Kevin acted alone. Kevin showed no remorse. This is the seventh consecutive month in which KV-0601 has self-sourced bread without civilian assistance, which has elevated his classification to Tier 3 Consumer (Self-Sufficient). Legal reviewed this entry and confirmed there is no law against finding bread on a bench. <span class="bread-type">Sourdough Roll</span> <span class="badge badge-verified">Logged &mdash; Tier 3 Notation</span></p>

						<p class="entry-body"><strong>KV-0201 (Kevin, Mallard)</strong> &mdash; Approximately 60g of whole wheat bread received from two civilians who appeared to be on a date.
