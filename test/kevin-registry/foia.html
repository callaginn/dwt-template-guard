				<h1>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests</h1>

				<p>The National Registry of Ducks Named Kevin is committed to transparency and public access to Kevin-related records as mandated by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552. You have the right to request any NRDNK record that is not otherwise exempt under FOIA Exemptions 1 through 9, provided the request is written clearly, filed correctly, and spiritually aligned with the concept of &ldquo;process.&rdquo;</p>

				<h2>What You Can Request</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Registration records for any specific Kevin (by registration number)</li>
					<li>Aggregated bread consumption data by region, species, or bread type</li>
					<li>Internal memos regarding Kevin-related policy decisions</li>
					<li>Field agent reports and incident documentation</li>
					<li>Meeting minutes from the Quarterly Kevin Review Board</li>
					<li>Budget allocations for the Division of Waterfowl Recovery Operations</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="notice">
					<h4>Processing Times</h4>
					<p>FOIA requests are processed in the order received. Current estimated processing time is 12&ndash;16 weeks (plus time to locate the email chain explaining why it is 12&ndash;16 weeks). Expedited processing is available in cases involving imminent threat to a Kevin&rsquo;s well-being or active litigation. To request expedited processing, attach a completed Form NRDNK-FOIA-2 (Expedited Processing Justification) and allow 5&ndash;7 business days for us to confirm we understand the word &ldquo;expedited.&rdquo;</p>
				</div>

				<h2>How to Submit a Request</h2>

				<p>All FOIA requests must be submitted in writing and should include a clear description of the records sought, your contact information, and a statement of willingness to pay applicable fees. Submit requests to:</p>

				<div class="notice notice-info">
					<p><strong>NRDNK FOIA Office</strong><br>
					1 Kevin Plaza, Suite 404<br>
					Washington, D.C. 20500<br>
					Email: <a href="mailto:foia@nrdnk.gov">foia@nrdnk.gov</a><br>
					Phone: (202) 555-7824</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Exemptions</h2>

				<p>Certain records may be withheld in whole or in part under applicable FOIA exemptions. Common exemptions invoked by the NRDNK include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Exemption 6 (Personal Privacy):</strong> Kevin home pond addresses and daily routines are protected under the Duck Identity Protection Act of 2003 (yes, ducks have privacy; no, you may not request their forwarding address).</li>
					<li><strong>Exemption 7(A) (Law Enforcement):</strong> Records pertaining to active missing Kevin investigations cannot be released until the case is resolved and the Kevin has been located or declared permanently missing (Form NRDNK-M9), whichever happens first and/or paperwork happens last.</li>
					<li><strong>Exemption 4 (Trade Secrets):</strong> Proprietary bread formulations submitted by bakeries under the Bread Reporting Program are exempt, because the government respects commerce almost as much as it respects a form.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If your request is denied, you may file an administrative appeal within 90 days using Form NRDNK-FOIA-3 (Appeal of FOIA Determination). The appeal will be reviewed by the Deputy Director for Records and Accountability, who has never once overturned a denial but remains, by all accounts, willing to receive your letter and place it carefully into the appropriate system.</p>
