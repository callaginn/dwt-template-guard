				<h1>About the National Registry of Ducks Named Kevin</h1>

				<p>The National Registry of Ducks Named Kevin (NRDNK) is the sole authoritative federal database of all domesticated and semi-domesticated waterfowl who have been formally named Kevin within U.S. territorial waters and their adjacent water features. If it&rsquo;s not in the Registry, it&rsquo;s not officially Kevin &mdash; it&rsquo;s just a duck with ideas.</p>

				<p>The Registry was established by Executive Order 13,242 on March 14, 2003, following the Great Unnamed Duck Incident of 2002, in which an estimated 400 to 600 ducks named Kevin were operating entirely off the books. The situation was described by the Secretary of Waterfowl Nomenclature at the time as &ldquo;untenable, frankly,&rdquo; and the department immediately began work on a solution consisting of a hotline, three committees, and an eight-week turnaround time.</p>

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>To ensure that every Kevin is known, documented, and accounted for. To maintain an accurate and up-to-date log of bread consumption events. To reunite missing Kevins with their home ponds. To serve the public with dignity, transparency, and access to Kevin-related data as required by the Freedom of Information Act (and also because we like knowing things).</p>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h3>How do I register a duck named Kevin?</h3>
				<p>Complete Form NRDNK-1 (Application for Initial Kevin Registration) and submit it to your regional flyway division office along with two (2) photographs of the duck, a completed Bread Preference Assessment (Form NRDNK-B0), and a $25 processing fee. Processing time is 8&ndash;12 weeks (plus 2&ndash;3 weeks for us to mail you a letter confirming we received your envelope). Expedited processing ($75) is available but not recommended, as the Registry has found that rushed registrations have a higher rate of Kevin misidentification and incorrect stapling, both of which are deeply serious.</p>

				<h3>What if my duck is named something else but answers to Kevin?</h3>
				<p>Unofficial use of the name Kevin does not constitute registration. You must submit Form NRDNK-1. The duck&rsquo;s subjective relationship with the name is not legally binding and will not be considered in the application review process. The Registry recognizes feelings, but cannot process them at this time.</p>
